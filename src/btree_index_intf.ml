  (** The type for indexes. *)

    t
  (** The constructor for indexes.

      @param flush_callback A function to be called before any new bindings are persisted to disk
      (including both automatic flushing and explicit calls to {!flush} or {!close}).

      This can be used to ensure certain pre-conditions are met before bindings are persisted to
      disk. (For instance, if the index bindings are pointers into another data-structure [d], it
      may be necessary to flush [d] first to avoid creating dangling pointers.)
      @param cache used for instance sharing.
      @param fresh whether an existing index should be overwritten.
      @param read_only whether read-only mode is enabled for this index.
      @param throttle the strategy to use when the cache are full and and async in already in
      progress. [Block_writes] (the default) blocks any new writes until the merge is completed.
      [Overcommit_memory] does not block but continues to fill the (already full) cache.
      @param log_size the maximum number of bindings in the `log` IO. *)

  (* TODO : [cache] is basically a (string, btree) hashtbl which maps a path to the btree living there *)

  val clear : t -> unit
  (** [clear t] clears [t] so that there are no more bindings in it. *)

  (* find_opt?  *)
  val find : t -> key -> value
  (** [find t k] is the binding of [k] in [t]. *)

  val mem : t -> key -> bool
  (** [mem t k] is [true] iff [k] is bound in [t]. *)

  val replace : ?overcommit:bool -> t -> key -> value -> unit
  (** [replace t k v] binds [k] to [v] in [t], replacing any existing binding of [k].

      If [overcommit] is true, the operation does not triger a merge, even if the caches are full.
      By default [overcommit] is false. *)

  val filter : t -> (key * value -> bool) -> unit
  (** [filter t p] removes all the bindings (k, v) that do not satisfy [p]. This operation is costly
      and blocking. *)

  val iter : (key -> value -> unit) -> t -> unit
  (** Iterates over the index bindings. Limitations:

      - Order is not specified.
      - In case of recent replacements of existing values (since the last merge), this will hit both
        the new and old bindings.     FIXME isn't this exposing internal details?
      - May not observe recent concurrent updates to the index by other processes.     Which ones, exactly? What is the spec for concurrent processes accessing the store? *)

  val flush : ?no_callback:unit -> ?with_fsync:bool -> t -> unit
  (** Flushes all internal buffers of the [IO] instances.

      - Passing [~no_callback:()] disables calling the [flush_callback] passed to {!v}.
      - If [with_fsync] is [true], this also flushes the OS caches for each [IO] instance. *)

  val close : ?immediately:unit -> t -> unit
  (** Closes all resources used by [t], flushing any internal buffers in the instance.

      If [immediately] is passed, this operation will abort any ongoing background processes. This
      guarantees not to corrupt the store, but may require additional work to be done on the next
      startup. *)

  (* TODO : close must actually close the file handles if there are no more reference to the cache, otherwise decrease the reference counter. Conversely, [v] must bump a cache reference counter *)

  val sync : t -> unit
  (** [sync t] syncs a read-only index with the files on disk. Raises {!RW_not_allowed} if called by
      a read-write index. *)

  (* what is merging exactly, for a B-tree? Exposes the existence of
     the WAL. Is the existence of the WAL part of the semantics? *)

  val is_merging : t -> bool
  (** [is_merging t] returns true if [t] is running a merge. Raises {!RO_not_allowed} if called by a
      read-only index. *)

  val merge : t -> unit
  (** [merge t] forces a merge for [t].

      If there is no merge running, this operation is non-blocking, i.e. it returns immediately,
      with the merge running concurrently.

      If a merge is running already, this operation blocks until the previous merge is complete. It
      then launches a merge (which runs concurrently) and returns. *)

  val try_merge : t -> unit
  (** [try_merge] is like {!merge} but is a no-op if the number of entries in the write-ahead log is
      smaller than [log_size]. *)

  val hash_size : int
  (** The number of bits necessary to encode the maximum output value of {!hash}. `Hashtbl.hash`
      uses 30 bits. Overestimating the [hash_size] will result in performance drops; underestimation
      will result in undefined behavior.  ... on collisions? FIXME *)

  val encode : t -> string
  (** [encode] is an encoding function. The resultant encoded values
     must have size {!encoded_size}. FIXME exactly??? probably OK, but
     a bit inefficient eg if encoded_size is large, but typical values
     are small *)

  val encoded_size : int
  (** [encoded_size] is the size of the result of {!encode}, expressed in number of bytes. *)

  val decode : string -> int -> t
  (** [decode s off] is the decoded form of the encoded value at the offset [off] of string [s].
